In this project I developed a model to predicted snow cover duration in Estonia. The analysis utilized historical temperature data, data on snow cover duration from 22 stations and a digital elevation model.

The basis of this analysis were:

1.  Raster datasets comprising historical (1970 to 2000) monthly temperature information for December, January, and February for Estonia.

2.  Vector data comprising snow cover duration data for 22 stations in Estonia

3.  A digital elevation model of Estonia in raster format

4.  Vector data on the borders of Estonia

I started with calculating average monthly winter temperatures from the historical temperature data sets. Then, using zonal statistics I extracted the average winter temperatures as well as the elevation values at the locations of the snow stations and combined the information into a single data frame and prepared it for regression analysis.

Then I conducted a correlation analysis to examine the relationship between snow cover duration and the variables: temperature, elevation, longitude and latitude and visualized these correlations using scatter plots with linear regression lines.

I thereafter developed a linear regression model to predict snow cover duration based on these predictors and evaluated the model's coefficients to understand the nature of the individual relationships and their statistical significance. I then predicted snow cover duration using the regression coefficients of all variables and visualized the prediction results. They can be seen on Figure 1:

I then prepared the data for spatial interpolation using Kriging. I therefore created a spatial grid over Estonia using 4000 grid cells. I then computed a sample variogram of the snow duration variable and then plotted the variogram, helping to understand the spatial structure of the snow duration data.

I then defined key parameters (nugget, sill, range) based on the sample variogram and generated a variogram model with Gaussian function. I then fit the model to the sample variogram and plotted the model.

Based on the spatial correlation structure defined by the variogram, I then performed Kriging interpolation on the duration variable. Thereby I predicted values at unsampled locations.

I then converted the interpolation results into a raster object and visualized the Kriging predictions of estimated snow cover duration across Estonia. These are displayed in Figure 2.
