Join me on an exhilarating journey as I delve into database creation, web scraping, and insightful analysis. In this project, I focused on currency rates relative to USD and constructed a robust database by daily scraping from an [API](https://api.exchangerate.host/latest/?base=USD). Leveraging [Docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) containers on [Railway.app](https://railway.app/), I established a remote database for seamless access and comprehensive analysis.

To enhance the database, I integrated [GDP data](https://www.worldometers.info/gdp/gdp-by-country/) by scraping and linking it with currency rates. Additionally, I meticulously sourced [country names and the currency codes](https://www.iban.com/currency-codes) to establish meaningful connections. By importing historical data spanning from the time of GDP growth measurement to my initial API scrape, I gained deeper insights for analysis.

Within the SQL database, I engineered a dynamic View that automatically updated with average monthly currency rates. Equipped with these powerful resources, I conducted an in-depth analysis to identify the fastest growing economies of 2017. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that the results were influenced by the recent strength of the dollar. Many currencies exhibited relative underperformance against USD, underscoring the robustness of the dollar in recent times. Notably, the Euro's performance, often aligned with the dollar, further illuminated the strengthening trend.

The process of scraping, database creation, and analysis was both enjoyable and rewarding. As a passionate data engineer, I thrive on solving puzzles and ensuring data aligns perfectly with my objectives. I eagerly anticipate undertaking more data engineering projects, pushing boundaries, and uncovering new insights.
